DevOps = Development (plan , code, test, build) + Operations(release, deploy, monitor, operate)

->Collaboration between development and operations teams
->Automation of software delivery processes
->Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)
->improve quality and speed

->Continuous Integration:	
		-Automatically build and test when there is change in code
		-Ensure the bug free code
		-Ensures highest code quality and reduces integration issues
		-Packaging the application(War/Jar/Docker image)
->Continuous Development:
		-Automatically deploy for production

Life cycle:
----------
code->Build->Test->Deployment

Tools:
-----
code-Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
Build-war/jar/Docker image
Test-Pytest, Junit test, SonarQube
Deploy-Apache/Tomcat, Docker , Kubernetes

Git:
---
Its a version control source code repository
